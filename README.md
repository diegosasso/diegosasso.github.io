# Notes:

Hello humans! This repository contains the source code and files used to build my personal academic website.

The website is build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)---an open-source static site generator---and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

It is deployed using Github Acations as described in this [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
